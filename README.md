This repository contains a shellcode encoder for 32-bit x86 that uses only 3 unique bytes: 0x4c, 0xe4, and 0xff. It was originally implemented as part of [@JohnLaTwC](https://twitter.com/JohnLaTwC/)'s [Green Shellcode challenge](https://twitter.com/JohnLaTwC/status/1107380892467490816) that he ran in 2008.
